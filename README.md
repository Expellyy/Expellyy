- Hi guys, it's me Expelly!
- You may know me as the creator of the MCC Sim Scorer, BW Teambuilder, as "simulation jesus" (not my idea), or from any events I play/test for
- I'm very interested in the Minecraft event scene, and most of my work here will be something like that
- I'm also very interested in Classics and Greek Mythology, so maybe you'll see something about that here
- If you have any ideas for stuff I can do, feel free to reach out!
  - You can message me here (if you can, kinda new to github lol), or @Expely on discord, my dms are open
  - You can also dm me on Twitter/X as @Expely, just I'm not very active there
- I mainly use Python, Google Sheets, JS and Kotlin, but I know a little bit of Java and Skript
- Pronouns: he/she/they

Stuff I've worked on:
- MCC Sim Scorer - A way to automatically score your MCC Simulations, and create a centralised place to simulate MCCs
- BW Sim Scorer - The same thing but for BlockWars. Coding Extraction so it can load in under 0.5 seconds was actually one of the hardest things I've done
- BW Teambuilder - Similar to the MCC Teambuilder by ultrasheeplord, a way to make teams for BlockWars while seeing how balanced it would be (warning: not updated for 2025)
- Best Game Orders - A tool to determine any teams' best and worst game orders (both for coins and placement) in an MCC when given the scores
- MCC Simulator - A half-joke sheet that automatically simulates an MCC, using pure randomness for every single way of gaining coins
- Weighted Random Sims - A "sequel" to MCC Simulator that does the same thing, but accounting for player skill (warning: slightly outdated, update coming eventually)
- [Simulating MCCs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eEx3x3UafZ "Discord Link") - A discord dedicating to Simulating MC Events
